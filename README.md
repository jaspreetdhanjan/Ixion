# Ixion

This source code was initially meant to be a "clean" rewrite of our existing codebase, the goal was to utilise modern OpenGL technologies. However, due to lack of time and resources this was never completed.

This repo is the latest work that was completed on the project (around three years ago).

Prior to this, we used BitBucket as version control repository hosting service. If you are interested in viewing the complete code to Ixion, you can view this code here: https://bitbucket.org/j_as/ixion/
